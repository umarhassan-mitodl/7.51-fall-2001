Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Required Texts
--------------

There is no required text. You should have a good undergraduate Biochemistry text (Stryer, Rawn, Voet & Voet, Matthews & van Holde, etc.). In addition, several copies of:

Creighton, T. E. _Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties_. 2nd ed. New York, NY: W.H. Freeman and Company, 1992. ISBN: 9780716770305.

Fersht, Alan. _Enzyme Structure and Mechanism_. 2nd ed. New York, NY: W.H. Freeman and Company, 1985. ISBN: 9780716716143.

Kyte, Jack. _Mechanism in Protein Chemistry_. New York, NY: Routledge, 1995. ISBN: 9780815317005.

———. _Structure in Protein Chemistry_. New York, NY: Routledge, 1995. ISBN: 9780815317012.

These will be in the reserve room of the library. These address some of the topics that we will cover and serve as a good alternative source of information. Class material will also be posted on the 7.51 homepage.

Exams and Problem Sets
----------------------

There will be a quiz, two exams during the semester and a final exam. All exams will be closed book but you may bring one page (8.5 x 11 in.) of notes, equations, etc. to the exam. Problem sets will be given out most weeks. These will not be graded or collected but doing them is important. Answers will be supplied. Collaboration with others is allowed on problem sets.
